* Aspeed Static Memory controller in SPI mode
* Aspeed SPI Flash Controller

Required properties:
  - compatible : Should be "aspeed,fmc" for Static Memory Controller (AST2400, AST2300?), or
		 "aspeed,smc" for the SPI flash controller
  - reg : the first contains the register location and length,
          the second through nth contains the memory mapping address and length
	  for the access window for each chips select
  - interrupts : Should contain the interrupt for the dma device if fmc
  - clocks : The APB clock input to the controller
  - #address-cells : must be 1 corresponding to chip select child binding
  - #size-cells : must be 0 corresponding to chip select child binding


Child node required properties:
  - reg : must contain chip select number in first cell of address, must
	  be 1 tuple long
  - compatible : may contain "vendor,part", must include "jedec,spi-nor"
		(see spi-nor.txt binding).

Child node optional properties:
  - spi-max-frequency - (optional) max frequency of spi bus (XXX max if missing)
  - spi-cpol        - (optional) Empty property indicating device requires
    	 		inverse clock polarity (CPOL) mode (boolean)
  - spi-cpha        - (optional) Empty property indicating device requires
    			shifted clock phase (CPHA) mode (boolean)
  - spi-tx-bus-width - (optional) The bus width(number of data wires) that
                        used for MOSI. Defaults to 1 if not present.
  - spi-rx-bus-width - (optional) The bus width(number of data wires) that
                        used for MOSI. Defaults to 1 if not present.

Child node optional properties:
 - see mtd/partiton.txt for partitioning bindings and mtd naming

	reg = < 0x1e620000 0x94

			bootloader {

		/* spi-max-frequency = <>; */
		status = "fail";
		/* m25p,fast-read; */
	};
